# About
HTTP (The Gem! a.k.a. http.rb) is an easy-to-use client library for making requests from Ruby. It uses a simple method chaining system for building requests, similar to Python's Requests.
Under the hood, http.rb uses http_parser.rb, a fast HTTP parsing native extension based on the Node.js parser and a Java port thereof. This library isn't just yet another wrapper around Net::HTTP. It implements the HTTP protocol natively and outsources the parsing to native extensions.

# Assumptions
You are familiar with:
OS: at least one Unix-like OS
ssh: ssh, ssh keys, ssh authorized keys file
git: basic use of git, bare and non-bare remotes
You are setting up a fresh, ssh-based, installation of gitolite on a Unix machine of some sort.
You have root access, or someone has created a userid called "git" for you to use and given you a password for it. This is a brand new userid (or you have deleted everything but .bashrc and similar files to make it look like one!)
If your server is not connected to the internet, you know how to clone the gitolite source code by using some in-between server or "git bundle".
Installation and setup

# Beautiful math in all browsers
MathJax is an open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation that works in all modern browsers. It was designed with the goal of consolidating the recent advances in web technologies into a single, definitive, math-on-the-web platform supporting the major browsers and operating systems. It requires no setup on the part of the user (no plugins to download or software to install), so the page author can write web documents that include mathematics and be confident that users will be able to view it naturally and easily. Simply include MathJax and some mathematics in a web page, and MathJax does the rest.
Some of the main features of MathJax include:
High-quality display of LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation in HTML pages
Supported in most browsers with no plug-ins, extra fonts, or special setup for the reader
Easy for authors, flexible for publishers, extensible for developers
Supports math accessibility, cut-and-paste interoperability, and other advanced functionality
Powerful API for integration with other web applications
